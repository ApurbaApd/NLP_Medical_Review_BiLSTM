## NLP Sentiment Analysis of Medical Records Using Bidirectional LSTM

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of medical records using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically applying  Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
neural network architecture. Sentiment analysis helps to understand the underlying sentiment or emotion expressed in textual data, which in the context of medical records can provide
insights into patient experiences and feedback.
